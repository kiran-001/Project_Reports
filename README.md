# **Project Reports Repository**

This repository contains detailed reports on various projects covering diverse fields such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, epidemiology, and esports analytics. These reports highlight methodologies, results, and insights derived from data-driven approaches.

## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Membership Inference Attack on Multimodal Models with Partial Knowledge**
- This project investigates Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on multimodal models under a partial knowledge setting, where attackers only have access to image data. It evaluates two attack strategies—Confidence-Based and Top-K Diversity-Based—on datasets like Flickr8k and COCO, revealing privacy vulnerabilities in multimodal AI systems.

### **2. Analysis of Depressive and Non-Depressive Tweets Using MLP**
- This study explores the sentiment patterns of depressive and non-depressive tweets in India using deep learning models. Leveraging sentiment scores from TextBlob and machine learning models such as MLP, the research analyzes 134,348 tweets to detect patterns in public mental health expressions.

### **3. Query Auto-Completion using Large Language Models**
- This project enhances Query Auto-Completion (QAC) using a transformer-based neural language model (FLAN-T5). By analyzing user query prefixes, the model predicts completions even for unseen queries, improving search accuracy. The approach outperforms traditional QAC methods in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) evaluations.

### **4. The Effect of Masking on COVID-19 Transmission**
-  This study reviews the role of face masks as a non-pharmaceutical intervention against COVID-19. It examines mask effectiveness in different environments, public response to mask mandates, and technological advancements in mask design. The research provides a holistic perspective on the societal and scientific implications of mask-wearing.

### **5. Predictive Analysis of Player Performance and Game Outcomes in CS:GO Matches**
-  Using machine learning techniques, this project analyzes over 1,400 CS:GO matches to predict player performance and match outcomes. Various models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, are employed to derive insights into the strategic and statistical elements that contribute to team success.

### **6. Using Machine Learning to Classify Ugandan Preschool Children's Drawings**
-  This research develops a machine learning model based on ResNet50 to classify Ugandan preschool children's drawings according to Lowenfeld’s artistic development stages: scribble, pre-schematic, and schematic. The model was trained on 757 labeled images and achieved an **intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.85** with human coders, along with **81% validation accuracy and 78% test accuracy**. By automating the classification process, the study facilitates large-scale analysis of children’s cognitive and artistic development, offering scalable solutions for similar research in educational and developmental psychology.

### **7. Enhancing Student Advising with Large Language Models: A Refined Approach**  

- This project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the academic advising process to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility. Traditional advising systems are often constrained by complex course structures and limited advisor availability. To address these challenges, we implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach, combining **vector-based and graph-based retrieval** to enhance response accuracy while minimizing LLM hallucinations.  

- Using **Neo4j for knowledge graph construction** and **LangChain for structured query processing**, this system effectively retrieves and synthesizes information from structured academic catalogs and unstructured course syllabi. The evaluation demonstrates that this AI-driven advising tool provides **more precise, contextually aware responses** compared to conventional LLM-based methods. This approach has the potential to streamline academic advising and be scaled across institutions.
